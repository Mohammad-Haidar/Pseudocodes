Procedure FibonacciSeries
  Input: limit (upper limit for Fibonacci series)
  SET firstNum = 0, secondNum = 1, nextNum = 0
  DISPLAY firstNum and secondNum as the first two numbers of the series
  Repeat line 6 to 8 until nextNum is less than or equal to n
  nextNum = firstNum + secondNum
  IF nextNum is less than or equal to n
    DISPLAY nextNum
  ENDIF
  firstNum = secondNum
  secondNum = nextNum  
End Procedure
